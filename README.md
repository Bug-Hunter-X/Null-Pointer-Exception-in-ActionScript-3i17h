This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript: accessing object properties without checking for null values.  The `bug.as` file shows the problematic code, which results in a null pointer exception if `getSomeObject()` returns null.  The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version with appropriate null checks.  This is a crucial concept in preventing unexpected crashes and improving the robustness of ActionScript applications.
